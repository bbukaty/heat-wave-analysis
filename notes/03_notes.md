 how often do heat waves happen across our coast / frequency of heat waves that have occurred

expand to year

we have measured intertidal temp data for fort ross, compare against that?

20 sites across california

we care more about the deep intertidal and the hottest hot days

it would help to have a 'yes this period was a heat wave'... but noone's ever included tide in the analysis


"this area had 5 events defined this way"

__

incorporate temp data, see if solar modal + tide gives accurate predictor of intertidal temperature

switch to mean low water, investigate how it's getting used in the query
(or mean low low)?

might see bigger shift in data in Puget Sound or Seattle

pick date range, location (lat long), threshold (mllw?), then get a graph of solar radiation
