## Notes
tree ring style indicator? difficult

Jonathan's undergrad project data from JPL (maybe not)

percentage of days when low tide occurs +-2hr from solar noon
2 months centered on the summer solstice

low low tide? low tide threshold

overlay tide and GHI for fort ross for one day

AyeTides -- export one day? figure out what the data source is

because tides shift slow an intersection of sun and tide is always gonna be 4-5 days

most basic question is where and when do heat waves most likely occur
 - e.g. our coast, march and april.

NSRDB looks good for cloudiness
