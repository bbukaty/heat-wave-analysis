goals for tonight:

- prepare questions
- identify data sources
- identify timeframe
- load and visualize one data source

next steps:
confirm NSRDB for sun intensity
debug API access and develop query for california coast (save output?)

investigate NOAA CO-OPS; load data and visualize

combine data (how? weighting?) and visualize

ultimate goals:
interactivity? -> web app stretch goal?
port to R for lab convenience?


## Questions

timeframe, we probably want up to present? past cutoff?

I looked into NSRDB, do you guys use that?

is the question of the project "which variables correlate most with heat shock?" ig not bc we don't know what a heat shock is...? 

any biological data we can use to correlate with heat stress that would "prove" we're finding heat shocks?
 - use model to keep an eye on current conditions and warn about conditions?
