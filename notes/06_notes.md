blue alaska plot:

- add line for daily mean temperature, line for 90th percentile
- mean for all january firsts, jan seconds, etc, wavy line, later years go above that line
- decadal scale, pick 2 years that are different
- for each of those years, hottest year or month
- if we still end up using 2016, mention el nino?


into supplemental: one day with tide sun and temp

oops, I forgot to validate the linear regression requirements

take all the temperature data for all january firsts, cut the 90th percentile of that, the line between 90th and top 10th
